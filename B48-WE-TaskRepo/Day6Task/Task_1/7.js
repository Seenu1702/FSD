/* Question Explain Why the Code is blasted and how to diffuse it and get “Diffused”.
var a = "2" > "12";
//Don't touch below this
if (a) {
  console.log("Code is Blasted")
}
else
{
  console.log("Diffused") 
} */





let a = "2" > "12"; // this will give out put as true because if it's a string that operator compare that give boolean result
 // if we need diffuse as result we need to change the operator or number

//Don't touch below this
if (a) {
  console.log("Code is Blasted")
}
else
{
  console.log("Diffused") 
}
