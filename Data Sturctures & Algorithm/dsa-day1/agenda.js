Why DSA?
    - Good way to test the problem solving ability
    - how we break big problems into smaller subtasks

What to expect in an interview?
    - How to get notice?
    - How does a typical interview look like?
    - What do they expect from a candidate?
    - What happens internally?
    - How are candidates evaluated?
    - They want not just the answers but an optimal answer
